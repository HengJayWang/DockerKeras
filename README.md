# Dockerbuilds-Keras

We like Keras.

My goal is to provide a variety of deep learning environments primarily for Keras.

Give me a star if you find these environments helpful.

Currently, an environment is retrievable through
```bash
docker pull honghu/keras:tf-cu9-dnn7-py3
```
which contains Keras (Tensorflow Backend), OpenCV as well as some common packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I have built this image based on CUDA 9 and cuDNN7 (with Python3).
